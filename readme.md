# Simple Headers
This is a collection of a few headers that I collected over the years either by my own making or through the internet. They contain lots of useful stuff that I often need when using C and Cpp.

I mostly use this for the [printing](src/simpleheaders/Logging/Logging.h) file, but the other are nice as well. Most stuff is commented (or is obvious from token names), but it's better to read this and understand it before using it (C macros are not nice). 

This is set up as an interface target in cmake so you can use cmake with it easily see [some of my other projects](https://github.com/fourrth/cvec2/tree/master/cmake/common.cmake) for an example.
